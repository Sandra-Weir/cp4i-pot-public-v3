## Introduction
The labs are grouped under varies Experience and in each Experience, you will see various labs.  We will cover both the ACE Toolkit and ACE Designer to build integrations. We will be creating Event flows and APIs with Designer and then import them into APIC.   Will also cover labs on Event Streams (Kafka), Asset Repository and Operations Dashboard for tracing.

## Environment overview and Setup 
Before starting the labs make sure that you have completed the to review the Overview and setup from the main page **[Environment overview and Setup instructions.](../index.md#lab-sections)**  
We will be using a shared cluster for most labs, but some will also use a common desktop (VDI) that contains the needed software. <br>
**NOTE: The PoT coordinator should have sent you an email with your student number and links to a VDI Linux desktop and the URL to be used for accessing the shared cluster.**

| [Toolkit Experience](Toolkit-Experience/index.md)       | **Basic PING flow with Toolkit** This is a basic toolkit lab that you will create a simple Ping flow and then test locally and deploy to the ACE runtime in CP4I.  We will also show how to distribute workloads using IBM App Connect Enterprise Callable Flows. 
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [SalesForce Experience](SF-Experience/index.md)       | **Multi-Style Integration with IBM App Connect and IBM API Connect the SalesForce experience**  Create no-code integrations using IBM App Connect and expose and manage the APIs created with IBM API Connect. We will also show the value of Event Driven flows to react to events in backend systems. 
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [ServiceNow Experience](SN-Experience/index.md)       | **Multi-Style Integration with IBM App Connect and IBM API Connect the ServiceNow experience**  Create no-code integrations using IBM App Connect and expose and manage the APIs created with IBM API Connect. We will also show the value of Event Driven flows to react to events in backend systems.
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **ACE Toolkit Labs**         | This section you will focus on basic as well as advance capabilities using ACE Toolkit to build integrations both API lead as well as Event Driven solutions. <br>**This lab is being worked on.**
