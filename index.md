**What is a Proof of Technology?**

Proof of Technology sessions are complimentary classes to build
understanding of IBM technology and software with practical
presentations and hands-on lab exercises. 

We will cover all the various components that are part of Cloud Pak for Integration. We will also discuss how these components can be used in combination. The following are the varies areas depending on your interest.

*  **IBM App Connect**
*  **IBM API Connect**
*  **IBM DataPower Gateway**
*  **IBM Event Streams**
*  **IBM MQ Advanced**
*  **IBM Aspera High Speed Transfer Server**


**Cloud Pak for Integration is IBM’s hybrid integration platform (HIP) that helps to solve**
- Complexity of integration. Integrating where apps and data that now live in hybrid landscapes including on-prem, and multiple clouds
- Need for speed. Agility in development, architecture, and operations aspects of integration
- Developer sharing and re-use of integration assets
- Unification of integration broad ranging integration technologies – e.g. iPaaS, API management, messaging, events


**Cloud Pak for Integration -- Unique Value and Capabilities**
1.  **Platform navigator and Common UI -** 
    The platform navigator and SSO allow you to work across multiple integration capabilities through the same user interface and security model, enabling a more consistent and intuitive experience, reduced learning curve, and greater productivity.
2.  **Cross Integration Tracing -**
    Tracing Cross integration tracing with Open Tracing enabling faster problem determination and analytics
3.  **Asset Repository -**
    Architects and Developers can find and re-use integration objects and collaborate to speed development.
4.  **Common logging, metering, and monitoring -**
    As your business scales, the number of integrations that you create and manage scale with it. Ensuring that you can quickly and effectively troubleshoot any issues across a large number of integrations helps to minimize disruption and drive efficiency. 
5.  **License simplicity and flexibility -** Rather than working on multiple pricing metrics, you can work with one single VPC metric. With the single VPC metric you can allocate and reallocate your licenses to any component within the Pak. You no longer have to plan the specific usage of each integration component before projects begin, and the proportions can change over time. 
6.	**Operational consistency -** Using Kubernetes, enables a consistent installation, deployment and operational experience across all of the capabilities. This dramatically simplifies automation of installation, deployment pipelines, and management of the environment. 
7.  **Easily portable to other clouds -**
    The Cloud Pak for Integration can run on RedHat OpenShift. This allows you to install and operate the Pak identically across multiple cloud vendors.
