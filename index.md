**What is a Proof of Technology?**

Proof of Technology sessions are complimentary classes to build
understanding of IBM technology and software with practical
presentations and hands-on lab exercises. 

We will cover all the various components that are part of Cloud Pak for Integration. We will also discuss how these components can be used in combination. The following are the varies areas depending on your interest.

*  **IBM App Connect**
*  **IBM API Connect**
*  **IBM DataPower Gateway**
*  **IBM Event Streams**
*  **IBM MQ Advanced**
*  **IBM Aspera High Speed Transfer Server**


**Cloud Pak for Integration is IBM’s hybrid integration platform (HIP) that helps to solve**
- Complexity of integration. Integrating where apps and data that now live in hybrid landscapes including on-prem, and multiple clouds
- Need for speed. Agility in development, architecture, and operations aspects of integration
- Developer sharing and re-use of integration assets
- Unification of integration broad ranging integration technologies – e.g. iPaaS, API management, messaging, events
- Easily portable to other clouds, since this can run on RedHat OpenShift. This allows you to install and operate the Pak identically across multiple cloud vendors.
